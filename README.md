## Brainstorming Game Ideas

### Core Guidelines

- Gameplay based on systems -> little code, lots of content
- Stylized graphics -> low effort, high impact
  - Low poly
  - Pixel art
  - Shader usage
- Simple mechanics -> easy to learn, hard to master
- Unique gameplay -> no direct clones
- Replayability -> randomization, procedural generation
- Ideally multiplayer -> more fun, more replayability
- Open source -> free to contribute
- Small price tag -> < 5â‚¬
